# Apply a glossary change

1. Re-read `glossary.md` (the user may have edited it). Update or add the row: `| English | <tgt> | Notes |`.
2. If the user asked only to commit the glossary, commit it alone first.
3. Find the occurrences of the old term:
   ```sh
   grep -n "<old>" src/<tgt>.md figures/*.<tgt>.txt
   ```
   Also check inflected or compound forms. For Japanese, the term inside longer compounds: e.g. 観光地 inside
   観光地名. Report the counts per file to the user.
4. Replace only after confirmation. Respect the context: don't change code blocks, inline code or quoted UI strings
   that must match the demo. Show any ambiguous cases to the user instead of replacing them.
5. If figure labels changed: `make figures`, then `make review FIGS="…"` for the affected figures (labels may now
   be longer).
6. Run `make`, then commit: "Glossary: <old> → <new>".
